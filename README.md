## Blah-Blah

**Blah-Blah** is a lightweight knowledge base of practical notes, lessons learned, and real-world solutions.

This repository focuses on **things that documentation often misses**—edge cases, dependencies, security customizations, and operational challenges encountered while working with systems like Docker, Airflow, and related infrastructure.

### What you’ll find

* Proven setup guides and fixes
* Gotchas and non-obvious dependencies
* Security and configuration patterns
* Notes based on real production experience

### Structure

```
blah-blah/
├── docker/     # Rootless Docker, dependencies, pitfalls, fixes
├── airflow/    # Security customizations, auth, hardening
└── ...
```

Blah-Blah is not a product or framework—just **shared experience, distilled**.
